Emplace and push are both similar to each other but under the hood,

-   PUSH needs to have a pre-placed object, and the it uses the method 
    COPY OR MOVE in involved meaning it takes a longer time and space 
    complexity which impacts on the efficiency.

-   On the other hand, EMPLACE does not need pre-placed object, and also
    does not use COPY or MOVE to insert a element, meaning less time and 
    space complexity which has a higher efficieny.
